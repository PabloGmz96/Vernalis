# Vernalis
Vernalis is a minimal Bash script for python virtual environment observability that works seamlessly with the largest custom Bash frameworks such as Oh-my-Bash or Oh-my-Zsh

## :memo: Usage
This script is nothing but a bash executable file wich can be run with the following command:
```sh
bash Vernalis/vernalis.sh
```

For the user's convenience the author suggest using the alias `chenv`that stands for `check environment` 

## :dart: Future development goal
- [ ] Insertion to the Oh-my-bash Plugin library
